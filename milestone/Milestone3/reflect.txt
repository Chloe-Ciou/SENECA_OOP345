Personally, I believe the most difficult part of this project is Milestone 3.
It took me a lot of time to understand its main concept and running process.
However, after looking more details of the code and discused with other classmates.
I figured it out. Additionally, I really think it is the hardest project I have ever done in the school,
thus I was happy about that I had started doing this project earlier, then I was not panic.
As a programmer, is better to start doing anyting earlier.
