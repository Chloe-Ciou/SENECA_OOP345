I have learned,
1. How to use two arguments version of the main function.
2. How to use initializer list to initialize constant data members within a user-defined object.
3. The concepts of linkage in c++ language: external linkage(extern), internal linkage (static), and non-existing.
4. The concepts of scopes in c++ language: local scope, class scope, namespace scope, and global scope.
