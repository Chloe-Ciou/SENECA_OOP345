I have learned:

1. How to use an STL vector to store and manage iProduct polymorphic objects.
2. How to declare and define an array of class variable of the TaxableProdunt class.
3. How to report and handle an exception thrown from the readProduct(std::ifstream&) function
4. The difference between get() and getline() functions.
